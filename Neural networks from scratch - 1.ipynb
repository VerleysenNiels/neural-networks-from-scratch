    "A neuron multiplies all the inputs with its weights and then takes the sum of these elements (= dot-product). Then it adds a bias to this value to come to an output. If we keep it like this we have a linear function (output = weights * inputs + bias) and of course the neuron is very limited in what it can learn. Therefore the output of the neuron is passed through an activation function first (activations seem to be discussed more in depth in later videos)\n"
